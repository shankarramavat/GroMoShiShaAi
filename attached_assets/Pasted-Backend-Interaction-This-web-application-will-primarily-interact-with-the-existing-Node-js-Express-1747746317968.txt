Backend Interaction: This web application will primarily interact with the existing Node.js (Express) backend built for the mobile app (Theme 1). No new separate backend is needed for this web MVP, just new API endpoints on the existing backend if required for web-specific functionalities (e.g., admin views if any).
Authentication:
User registration and login will use Firebase Authentication (client-side SDK).
The Firebase ID token will be sent to the Node.js backend for verification and session management (issuing its own JWT for the web session, or relying on Firebase session persistence).
